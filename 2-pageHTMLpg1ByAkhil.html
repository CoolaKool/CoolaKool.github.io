		  <ul class="text">
			  <li class="text"><a href="#Pizza" class="l">Pizza</a></li>
			  <li class="text"><a href="#Salad1" class="l">Salad</a></li>
			  <li class="text"><a href="#VB" class="l">Veggie Burgers</a></li>
			</ul>
		 <p class="text">I like these foods for numerous reasons. For pizza, I generally like cheese and tomato sauce. Add those plus a lot of yummy toppings, and it's pretty much a picture-perfect deal for me. Salad is awesome because of the ranch and the tast overall. I would love to eat burgers, but I am a vegetarian, so veggie burgers are the next on the list for me. The bun and pattie taste really good, and the entire dish topped off with some ketchup - can't get better than that.
		 <h3 class="text">Brief History of Foods</h3>
		 <h4 id="Pizza" class="text3">Pizza</h4>
		 <p class="text">Pizza is an amazing, world-wide delicacy that almost everyone knows about. It is an Italian food that evolved from similar dishes in the early 19th century. The word 'pizza' was documented in 997 in Gaeta and spread across parts of the world.</p>

		 <h4 id="Salad1" class="text3">Salad</h4>
		 <p class="text">Salad is another well-known food that originated way back when, in the ancient times. Ancient Greeks and Romans layered and mixed vegetables, herbs, and other foods to make salad. The first salad dressings were vinegar and oil, used by the Babylonions long ago.</p>

		 <h4 id="VB" class="text3">Veggie Burgers</h4>
		 <p class="text"><strong id="j"><em>Most</em></strong> burgers are not veggie burgers. The veggie burger requires a special pattie without any of the usual meat in it to be special. This pattie was developed in the 1980s, but there is no concrete evidence to who made it first. In around 1981, Paul Wenner supposedly developed the first veggie burger, but according to another source, Gregory Sams invented it in 1982.</p>
